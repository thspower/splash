          Shotokan is a school or style of karate. It is a martial art which was
          developed in Japan by Gichin Funakoshi (1868–1957).[1] In the past,
          people practiced this martial art in many countries. Shotokan is still
          popular in modern culture. Karate is primarily a combat sport done
          with bare hands. That is the meaning of Kara-te: empty hand. So then
          the only weapons that can be used against a fighter are parts of the
          body. There are many styles of karate in different parts of the world.
          Shotokan is a style of karate that comes mainly from a small island
          south of Japan named Okinawa Island. The person who began this martial
          art was Gichin Funakoshi. This master practised karate all his life.
          He taught for many years and he wrote a book about his art. In 1939,
          Funakoshi established the first Shotokan dojo. To exercise you must
          wear a karate uniform and a belt that tells what your level of
          experience is. The order of karate belts is as follows for beginner to
          advanced levels: white, yellow, orange, green, blue, purple, brown and
          black. (The order of the belts may vary depending on the style of
          karate). After the black belt, there are nine more levels before
          finishing all notions of karate. In a fight, you must wear shin
          guards, gloves, a chest protector and a mouth piece. The heart of
          karate: In this sport, people must learn the Japanese language to
          understand all technic. The very foundation of karate Shotokan is the
          expression OSS. This means: heart, courage, patience, spirit and never
          give up. For welcome and to thank the Sensei (Master) this way, say
          OSS!
